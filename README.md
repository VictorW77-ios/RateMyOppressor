# Rate My Oppressor
Rate My Oppressor builds on my previous [Ruby gem] (https://github.com/VictorW77-ios/Popo-Cli-Project) command-line interface and works to balance the power dynamic between The People and law enforcement by allowing its users to leave reviews on officers in the Chicago Police Department.
